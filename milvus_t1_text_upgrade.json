Persistent low lung volumes with worsening opacities at both bases with associated indistinctness of the pulmonary vascularity.  Therefore, I would favor the presence of pulmonary edema rather than an infectious process. Clinical correlation, however is advised.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess given low lung volumes and patient rotation on the current examination. Clips within the left upper quadrant are again seen.",

The elevation of the right lung base is primarily due to a large chronic right pleural effusion.  The elevated and enlarged right hilus, adjacent radiation fibrosis and apical pleural thickening are chronic.  A second region of more focal edema in the right upper lobe sitting on the minor fissure is probably due to disturbed lymphatic drainage from the radiated lung.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.
